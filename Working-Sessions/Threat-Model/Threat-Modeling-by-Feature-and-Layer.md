## Outcomes

### Synopsis/Takeaways

#### Address Lookup (external entity)



#### Delivery Service (External)

**Threats**

- Fake delivery services
- Tampering of quantity
- Reproduction of confirmation response
- Reversal of data direction

**Assumptions**

- TLS is used
- Threat models exist for TLS
- Paid Service
- A Quote-flow is generated

#### Juice Shop User (External)

**Threats**

- Weak user authentication allows the user to be spoofed easily (spoofing, EoP)
- No Audit trail for user activity exists (repudiation)
- Weak account management security allows account takeover, e.g. lack of email confirmation (spoofing, EoP)
- Admin console available due to lack of authentication (EoP)
- Admin console security relies on obfuscation (information disclosure)
- POST-SESSION: User is able to input malicious data (EoP)

**Assumptions**

- TLS is used
- Threat models exist for TLS
- User is authenticated

#### Email Service (External)

**Threats**

- Service is misused
- Juice Shop sends malicious emails
- Connected to the correct service
- BCC abused
- HTML body injection
- Header injection
- Juice Shop sending spam
- Email message tampering
- Sent confirmation
- Sensitive data sent in emails
- Tracking mechanism (privacy)

**Assumptions**

- Rest API
- TLS is used
- Threat models exist for TLS
- Delivery confirmation
- Validated reputation



#### Invoice Tracking (Internal)

**Threats**

- Unauthorised access to the invoice service
- Page is obfuscated
- Discouragement of business sensitive data (Prices, Quantities)
- Discouragement of user sensitive data
- Audit trail of the invoice
- Manipulation of invoice data
- Logging of read access
- Screen scraping

**Assumptions**

- Page is within the application
- User is authenticated
- Used only for delivery services
- Not built for user invoicing

#### Takeaways

- Went through the user story handling the address lookup delivery service
- Threats were identified for the service that threat model templates need to be created for: TLS, e-mail etc.
- The discussion did not resolve the level of threat we should be looking at
